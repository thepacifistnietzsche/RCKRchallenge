RCKR challenge solution

Hi This was done in response to a coding challenge a friend suggested. I know the program is really ugly . Please forgive my inexperience as a beginner in coding. 

NB Pleases note the solution was not working on the challenge page. So I tried a lot of hit and miss and finally completed the challenge but the surprising thing is the answer on the challenge page is wrong as it does not satisfy the problem statement which is given below 
Find latitude and longitude of utmost 20 countries, ordered by population, with a population greater or equal to the population limit given below and have atleast one currency exclusively for themselves. (countries like Madagascar, Sri Lanka but not India, USA). Use the country details from this dataset.
Your task is to find the sum of the length of all lines (in kms) that can be drawn between co-ordinates of these countries.
Assume radius of earth: 6371 km
Round length of each line and final result to 2 decimal points
If co-ordinates are missing for any country use 0.000 N 0.000 E

They have apparently prepared a solution which skips the null value for some countries. I have added the program that gets the solution as well. 

Correct program - Untitled2
Program that give solution to the program - Challengesolution

Criticism and improvements are welcome
